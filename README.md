## Description
This project develops a blockchain-based traceability system to ensure the authenticity, quality, and sustainability of Ayurvedic herbs. Using a permissioned blockchain, every stage—from geo-tagged harvesting and processing to testing and packaging—is securely recorded. Smart contracts enforce sustainability and quality standards, while QR codes on products let consumers trace origin, view lab results, and verify ethical sourcing. By integrating blockchain, IoT, and geo-tagging, the system brings transparency, trust, and accountability to the Ayurvedic herbal supply chain.
